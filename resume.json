    "summary": "I live in Ghana (that's in West Africa) where I got my degree in Computer Engineering. I worked for two years as a Backend Developer/Support Engineer for DreamOval Limited one of the top software firms in Africa within the Fintech space. Most of my work was bespoke(customized based on a platform my team built called Enterprise Nurs)  for enterprise clients like GCB Bank, Stanbic Bank and Fidelity Bank. I built data intensive software that pooled data from multiple data silos and gave our banking clients a 360 degree view of their customers. This greatly improved customer engagement. Most of this was done in Java using Spring. I'm a perpetual learner and I enjoy solving problems especially hard ones. My skill set spans many fields and disciplines but I currently call software development and engineering home. I spend my days figuring out the best possible way to meet a clients need using the technology and frameworks available to me.",
