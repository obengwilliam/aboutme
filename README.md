I'm a software developer with 4+ years industry experience. I build data intensive enterprise level web applications software and solid APIs. I work in Java, JavaScript and sometimes Python. I'm a perpetual learner and I enjoy solving problems especially hard ones. My skill set spans many fields and disciplines but I currently call software development and engineering home. I spend my days figuring out the best possible way to meet a client's needs using the technologies and frameworks available to me.

Customer stickiness measures a customer’s loyalty to your company. Why is this important? 

Losing customers typically:
- Costs your company more than  acquiring
- Damages your company’s brand

Enterprise Nurs is a suite of applications that help you drive customer stickiness - an imperative for any resilient profitability strategy. Each application is designed to drastically elevate your customer experience from inside out. Its state-of-the-art micro service architecture also means scaling is on demand and not wholesale.What differentiates Nurs is its ease of integration even with legacy systems. Unlike the typical 3-6 month implementation period for most enterprise solutions, Enterprise Nurs can be fully deployed in a month.
Worked primarily on the Live Notification System
